# Delete Old Downloads (DOD)

Delete Old Downloads, or DOD, is a script written in Powershell to delete older downloads. The default amount of days old a download must be to get deleted is 90 days, but it can be changed in the script to any number.

## Additional Features

DOD also includes a feature that can send an email of what downloads were deleted in HTML format. You must edit the 'DOD.ps1' file to include a sending email address, the senders password, a receiving address, the SMTP server URL, and port number.

More features are planned as well as a guide to setting up the script as a scheduled Windows task.
